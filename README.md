# External Rename Handler

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that handles renames in the vault made outside of Obsidian app.

By default, Obsidian does not handle renames made outside of the app. It treats them as pair of `create`/`delete` events.

This plugin handles renames made outside of Obsidian app by treating them as a single `rename` event.

> [!WARNING]
>
> The plugin works only if Obsidian is running during the external renames.
>
> The plugin only handles renames for those files/folders that Obsidian tracks.
>
> The plugin only handles renames made inside the vault.
>
> The plugin doesn't handle the renames made outside of the vault even if the renamed files are referenced within the vault.
>
> The plugin doesn't handle the renames in files/folders that start with `.` (dot).
