# External Rename Handler

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that handles renames made outside of Obsidian.

By default, Obsidian will not handle renames made outside of Obsidian. It treats them as pair of `create`/`delete` events.

This plugin handles renames made outside of Obsidian by treating them as a single `rename` event.

For this functionality to work, Obsidian has to be running during the external renames.

## Installation

- `External Rename Handler` is not available in [the official Community Plugins repository](https://obsidian.md/plugins) yet.
- Beta releases can be installed through [BRAT](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian42-brat).
